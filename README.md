# EverGreen - Environmental Reserve Certification Platform 🌿

A blockchain-based platform that enables landowners to tokenize their environmental reserves as NFTs, providing transparent and verifiable proof of environmental preservation.

## 🌍 Overview

EverGreen transforms environmental preservation efforts into digital certificates using NFT technology on the Solana blockchain. The platform integrates satellite imagery and environmental data to create unique digital certificates that represent verified environmental reserves.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Satellite Integration**: Automatic fetching of satellite imagery based on geographical coordinates
- **Environmental Data Verification**: Collection and verification of key environmental metrics:
  - Vegetation coverage
  - Water bodies count
  - Springs count
  - Hectares calculation
  - Ongoing preservation projects
- **NFT Generation**: Creation of unique digital certificates with:
  - Satellite imagery
  - Environmental metrics
  - Verification timestamps
  - Unique identifiers
- **Blockchain Integration**: Secure minting and storage on Solana
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with Phantom wallet

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: Solana with Rust and Anchor
- **Wallet**: Phantom Wallet integration
- **Maps**: Satellite imagery API integration
- **Storage**: IPFS for NFT metadata

## 💡 Usage

1. Connect your Phantom wallet
2. Input environmental reserve coordinates
3. Fill in the environmental metrics form
4. Submit for verification
5. Receive your environmental NFT certificate

## 🔒 Security

- All transactions are secured through Solana blockchain
- Environmental data is verified through satellite imagery
- NFT metadata is stored on IPFS for permanence
- Smart contract ensures immutable record keeping
